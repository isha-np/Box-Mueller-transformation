# Box-Mueller-transformation
The Box-Mueller transformation can be used to obtain two independent and identically distributed (IID) Gaussian random variables (RVs) from two IID uniform RVs. generate M samples of the RVs R and Z and plot the probability density function (PDF) of each RV using histograms.
